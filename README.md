## Introduction

![](imagepriortitle.png)

The [Deep Image Prior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Image_Prior) is a convolutional neural network (CNN), designed to solve
various inverse problems in computer vision, such as denoising, inpainting and super-resolution. Unlike other CNNs designed for these kinds of tasks, the Deep Image Prior does not need any training data, besides the corrupted input image itself. Generally speaking, the network is trained to reconstruct the corrupted image from noise. However, since the architecture of the Deep Image Prior fits structured (natural) data a lot faster than random noise, one can observe that in many applications recovering the noiseless image can be done by stopping the training process after a predefined number of iterations. The authors of the paper ([Ulyanov et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10925)) explain this as follows:

> [...] although in the limit the parametrization can fit un-
structured noise, it does so very reluctantly. In other words,
the parametrization offers high impedance to noise and low
impedance to signal.

This page features an independent reproduction of some of the results published in the original paper, without making use of the already available open-source code. We will describe the design steps that were necessary to get the architecture running and we will explain which ambiguities had to be resolved when interpreting the text material provided by the authors.
